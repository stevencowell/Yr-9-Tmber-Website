          <h4>Understanding WHS Signage</h4>
          <p>Workplace Health and Safety (WHS) signage is critical in a workshop. These signs use specific colours and shapes to alert you to hazards:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Indicates danger or prohibition (e.g. no entry zones).</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Warns of potential hazards such as slippery surfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Provides information and instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Denotes the location of safety equipment and emergency exits.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Additional Resource: Workplace Safety Signs</h4>
          <p>For further information on the safety signs you may encounter in a workplace, please visit the following webpage:</p>
          <p><a href="https://skillstrainingcollege.com.au/guide-to-health-and-safety-signs-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Guide To Health And Safety Signs In The Workplace</a></p>
          <p>This resource explains the different categories of WHS signs as per Australian standards and provides visual examples and usage guidelines.</p>
          <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Why are WHS signs critical in maintaining a safe work environment?</li>
            <li>What are the key differences between prohibition, mandatory, and warning signs? Provide examples.</li>
            <li>How do colours and symbols aid in communicating safety messages effectively?</li>
            <li>In what ways can the information on the resource be applied in a timber workshop?</li>
            <li>What challenges might you face in ensuring that safety signs are visible and effective?</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Tools</h4>
          <p>This week, you will also be introduced to essential PPE and marking and measuring tools, which are crucial for precision and safety.</p>
          <h4>The Importance of a Safety-First Mindset</h4>
          <p>Developing a safety-first mindset is essential. A secure, organised workshop allows you to focus on refining your skills without compromising safety.</p>

        <summary><strong>Week 2: Hand Tools and Timber Defects</strong></summary>
        <article>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>In Week 2, the focus shifts to the effective use of hand tools and the critical process of identifying timber defects. Precision in tool use and recognising imperfections is key to producing high-quality timber work. This in-depth article will guide you through proper techniques, maintenance routines, and best practices to ensure both safety and craftsmanship.</p>
          <h4>Proper Use of Hand Tools</h4>
          <p>Hand tools are the cornerstone of traditional woodworking. In this week’s practical sessions, you will work with essential tools such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Jack Plane:</strong> Used for smoothing and shaping timber. Learn the correct angle and pressure required for an even finish. Regular sharpening is essential to maintain its effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Marking Gauge:</strong> Critical for scoring accurate lines along the wood. Ensure that the gauge is calibrated properly before use to guarantee precision in your markings.</li>
            <li><strong>Try Square:</strong> Essential for checking the squareness of workpieces. Using a try square correctly helps ensure that joints are aligned accurately, contributing to the overall quality of your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenon Saw:</strong> Designed for precise cutting along marked lines, particularly on the waste side. Controlled, steady strokes are vital for clean cuts and reducing errors.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Timber is a natural material and often comes with inherent imperfections. Recognising these defects is crucial for selecting the best pieces for your project and ensuring the final product's structural integrity and appearance. Common defects include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Knot:</strong> Natural imperfections where branches once grew. While small knots can add character, large or loose knots may weaken the timber.</li>
            <li><strong>Dent:</strong> Impact marks or depressions that can compromise the wood's strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Irregular Grain:</strong> Variations in the wood grain may indicate stress or inconsistency, making it challenging to achieve smooth cuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Sap Veins:</strong> Dark lines that can signal areas of weakness within the timber.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Identifying these defects early allows you to plan your cuts effectively. For example, you may reserve timber with minimal defects for load-bearing components while using less critical pieces for aesthetic features.</p>
          <h4>Best Practices for Tool Maintenance and Timber Selection</h4>
          <p>Successful woodworking depends on both well-maintained tools and carefully selected timber. Consider the following practices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Inspection:</strong> Always check your tools for damage or dullness and sharpen or repair them as necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Timber Selection:</strong> Inspect timber thoroughly for defects before starting your project. Mark any imperfections and plan your work accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Organised Workspace:</strong> Maintain a clean and organised workspace to minimise accidents and improve efficiency.</li>
          </ul>
